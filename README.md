# Headbase Relay Server
A websocket server allowing peers to connect and relay messages.  

The server implementation itself is very generic, however the intention within Headbase is for it to be used for "peer to peer style" synchronisation of 
data between devices.

## Contributions
This project is currently open source, not open contribution.
This is a personal project in its early stages. You're welcome to try it out, ask questions, raise bug reports etc but
it wouldn't be practical to accept external code contributions or feature requests yet.

I'm open to this changing in the future once the project is more stable, collaboration is one of the great things about open source after all!
